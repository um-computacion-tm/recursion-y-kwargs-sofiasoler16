#How it works
This is a function that allows receiving the first and last names of a person to check if they are in the database. Once found, it returns the ID of the

location where the person is in the database. If there is not enough data provided and there are more than 1 person with the same name, it returns the 

quantity of people with that name. If the person is not in the database, it returns 'no hay' (there isn't).

##How to use it
Once you clone de repository in your computer, you have to run the test using python3 base_de_datos/test_db.py
